Companon is designed to ensure the safety of users above all else.
It is important that the system is able to recognize when a user is in a high-risk mental state and to provide the appropriate resources. 
Key stakeholders consist of primarily young adults and, as they are the most at-risk group for adverse mental health.
Secondary stakeholders also include, crisis hotlines, therapists, and mental-health advocates.
Many young adults lack the financial resources for adequate mental health services, so Companon is designed to help link these two groups together.
