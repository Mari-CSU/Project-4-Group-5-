Companon is an anonymous AI-companion designed to provide users a safe space to vent and to receive consultation for their mental wellbeing. 
Through an intuitive chat window, Companon will simulate the ease of texting a close friend, all while guiding users to strong mental health resources.  
Companon is NOT a replacement for therapy, but simply acts as a gateway for better mental health services. 
This means providing links to mental health services, such as local therapists, crisis text lines, and articles regarding each user’s specific problem. 
Companon focuses on providing the user with an anonymous experience, as to protect them from potential leaks. 
Chat logs would remain stored within our internal servers, it is imperative that this data remains anonymous. 
While no direct personal information will be stored, anonymous data will be collected to improve the functionality of the system. 
This helps ensure the personal safety of each one of our users, bridging the gap between vulnerable people and professional care networks. 

The idea for the creation of this organization came from a concern connected to the loneliness epidemic - how people are unable to create stable relationships, 
which would usually help them to talk about their emotions and support them through harder parts in life.
Now, many people feel like they don’t receive any form of emotional support, which is one of the main reasons why we decided to create Companon - to allow people to talk about their feelings and help them in these hard moments,
when the loneliness gets to heavy and you feel like you are drowning in it.

The purpose of Companon is to create a safe and ethical space where young adults can seek mental health support without fear of judgment or data exploitation. 
Our core values include privacy, transparency, empathy, and responsible innovation, which guide every decision we make. 
The mission of the platform is to connect vulnerable users to trusted resources while protecting their autonomy and personal information. 
By embedding ethical safeguards and user control into the system, Companon aims to build lasting trust and reduce barriers to care.
