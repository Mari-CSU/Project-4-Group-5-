Companon is an anonymous AI-companion designed to provide users a safe space to vent and to receive consultation for their mental wellbeing. 
Through an intuitive chat window, Companon will simulate the ease of texting a close friend, all while guiding users to strong mental health resources.  
Companon is NOT a replacement for therapy, but simply acts as a gateway for better mental health services. 
This means providing links to mental health services, such as local therapists, crisis text lines, and articles regarding each user’s specific problem. 
Companon focuses on providing the user with an anonymous experience, as to protect them from potential leaks. 
Chat logs would remain stored within our internal servers, it is imperative that this data remains anonymous. 
While no direct personal information will be stored, anonymous data will be collected to improve the functionality of the system. 
This helps ensure the personal safety of each one of our users, bridging the gap between vulnerable people and professional care networks.
