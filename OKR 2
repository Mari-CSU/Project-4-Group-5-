Companon will design and develop a monitoring system that would detect signs of suicidal thoughts and intentions in user chats with the AI-companion and help the user to receive necessary help.
The focus of the system will be to analyze the written text, emotional values, and behavioral patterns through Natural Language Processing (NLP), which would look for any concerning signs in the messages sent by the users.
When the program detects any sign of suicidal ideation, it would provide outside resources such as links or contact information to the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or the International Association for Suicide Prevention based on the geographical location of the user.
The system will be operated solely within the Companon chat interface without the need for additional actions from the user, which also helps to access help and guidance without any interruptions.
Additionally, the program will prevent the user from accessing information connected to self-harm or suicide as a way of prevention - instead, it will show the user information about crisis support resources.
