Companon will design and implement a privacy-first system that ensures the secure storage and handling of user information,especially for vulnerable young adults seeking mental health support.
The platform will feature a user-facing privacy dashboard that allows individuals to control their data, including options to download, delete, and manage consent settings.
All team members will complete certified data privacy training prior to launch to ensure ethical handling of sensitive information. 
A third-party privacy audit will be conducted to verify that all protections meet industry standards, with the goal of passing without any critical findings.
By prioritizing transparency, encryption, and user autonomy, Companon aims to build trust and create a safe space where users feel confident seeking help.
